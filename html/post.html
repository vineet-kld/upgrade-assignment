            Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix expanded the
            range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless
            drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion forever transformed the
            sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized
            diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll,
            psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He was
            instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to
            popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected the standard barre chord fretting
            technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb.[349] He
            applied this technique during the beginning bars of "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root
            note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb
            playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350]
            Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines
            together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was the
            first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren
            of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source.
            Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and
            others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3][nb
            42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
